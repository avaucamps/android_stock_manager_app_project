When the user first opens the app, he can see the products he has in stock and their quantity. The products are placed in tabs representing
moments of day, a product is visible in the tab of the moment(s) of day it is supposed to be consumed at. For example, vegetables can be 
eaten at noon, so the user could have the following screen when he opens up the app:
